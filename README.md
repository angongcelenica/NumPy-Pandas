# Numpy
Numpy is a great tool for data analysis on arrays which performs various tasks and handles large datasets effectively and efficiently at fast speeds. In order to overcome the issue of not being able to calculate effectivvely and efficiently arrays are used to overcome that barrier. Arrays are described as a collection of values that can have one or more dimensions. An array with one dimensions normally known as a vector and two dimensions is a matrix.
